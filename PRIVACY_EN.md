# Privacy Policy – Titan 2 Keyboard

Effective date: November 23, 2025

The **Titan 2 Keyboard** application (the “App”) is a software keyboard designed for Android devices. We respect your privacy and are committed to ensuring that no data is collected or processed beyond what is strictly necessary for the App to function as a keyboard.

## 1. Data controller

The App is provided by:
**[YOUR NAME / DEVELOPER NAME]**  
Contact: **[YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS]**

## 2. Scope of data processing

The App **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal data.

In particular:
- The App **does not collect** the text you type.
- The App **does not send** any data to any external servers.
- The App **does not use** analytics, tracking, or advertising.
- The App **does not create** any user profiles.

All processing performed by the keyboard is limited to handling key presses **locally on your device**.

## 3. Typed text

Text entered using Titan 2 Keyboard:
- is processed **only locally** on your device,
- is passed only to the app in which you are currently typing (e.g. messenger, browser, notes),
- is **not stored** by the App in any external database and is not transmitted over the internet.

Users should always use the keyboard responsibly and avoid entering sensitive information into apps they do not trust.

## 4. App permissions

The App may use certain system permissions solely to provide core keyboard functionality (e.g. displaying the keyboard, vibration feedback, colour themes).

The App:
- **does not access** call logs, contacts, location, camera, microphone, or external storage for the purpose of collecting user data,
- **does not use** any permissions for advertising or analytics.

If additional permissions are ever required in the future, their scope will be limited to keyboard features and will be clearly described in the Google Play listing.

## 5. Children

The App is not specifically directed at children, but it may be used by them as a standard system keyboard.  
Since the App **does not collect any data**, no personal data of children is processed.

## 6. Sharing data with third parties

The App:
- **does not share** any data with third parties,
- **does not use** external analytics, advertising, or tracking libraries (such as Google Analytics, Facebook SDK, etc.).

## 7. Security

Because the App does not collect or store any user data, the risk of a personal data breach is minimized.  
The security of the text you type depends mainly on:
- the security of the operating system,
- the app in which you type,
- the configuration of your device (e.g. absence of malware).

## 8. Changes to this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated if the functionality of the App changes or if required by applicable law.

Any material changes to this Privacy Policy will be communicated by updating the App description on Google Play and/or updating this document in the repository (e.g. on GitHub).
